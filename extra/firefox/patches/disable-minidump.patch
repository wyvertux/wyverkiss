Patch from Void Linux. Here's the full message for the ff87-update, but
we're only taking the minidump_writer_linux part as it's the only
relevant one for Firefox on Wyverkiss.

Subject: [PATCH] firefox: update to 87.0.

minidump_writer_linux has issues on musl and doesn't support all
platforms Void does (thread_info doesn't touch ppc*), so we add a patch
to not build it at all. It seems to be a build system bug where
oxidized_breakpad can be enabled even when --disable-backtrace is set.
If next version still only enables it for x86_64, it might build/work
fine for us, see: https://github.com/msirringhaus/minidump_writer_linux/issues/4
