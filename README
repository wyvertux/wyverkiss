Wyverkiss is an alternative rootfs for KISS Linux. If KISS goes GNU, we
go the opposite.

Wyverkiss (unlike Wyvertux) is supposed to closely track KISS Linux as
much as possible. It means the Wyverkiss repo will only be used as an
"overlay" for KISS Linux to work outside the GNU toolchain ecosystem
(except for a select few programs that will be needed). The changes made
in Wyverkiss will be upstreamed if possible.

Ideally, this repository should be almost empty or unneeded at all. But
that would be highly unrealistic.


Changes
_______________________________________________________________________

- The GCC suite (gcc, libstdc++, libgcc, etc.) are replaced by the LLVM
  suite (clang, libc++, compiler-rt, etc.)
- binutils are replaced with its LLVM counterpart (except GNU as,
  which are packaged separately)
- byacc replaced bison (patching might be needed for a few packages)
- pigz replaced gzip (this one's already upstreamed, but we'll keep
  using the pigz name instead of gzip)
- bmake replaces GNU make, but the latter are still available as it's
  absolutely needed by some packages. It uses the gmake name
- netbsd-curses replaces ncurses as an alternative, thanks to Sabotage
  Linux
