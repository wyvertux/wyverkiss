Unfortunately, due to my upcoming job and a lot of better solutions for
GNU-less Linux systems, Wyverkiss is no longer under active development
for now. You're encouraged to move your installation to other active
alternatives.

If you want to keep a KISS Linux experience, You can use:

- Glasnost Linux (https://github.com/glasnostlinux/glasnost)

If you don't really care about package manager or minimal experience,
you can try:

- Chimera Linux (https://chimera-linux.org/)
- Iglunix (https://github.com/iglunix)

I don't think I'll be able to continue working on Wyverkiss given my
current situation, but the repo will not be archived, just in case.

________________________________________________________________________

Wyverkiss is an alternative rootfs for KISS Linux. If KISS goes GNU, we
go the opposite.

Wyverkiss (unlike Wyvertux) is supposed to closely track KISS Linux as
much as possible. It means the Wyverkiss repo will only be used as an
"overlay" for KISS Linux to work outside the GNU toolchain ecosystem
(except for a select few programs that will be needed). The changes made
in Wyverkiss will be upstreamed if possible.

Ideally, this repository should be almost empty or unneeded at all. But
that would be highly unrealistic.


Changes
